This theme is easy to setup, but to keep the theme true to its design, the are a few things to look at.

# This theme has a horizontal top-navigation bar. Make sure the site has a blockgroup named 'topnav' (which is a blockgroup that is present in a default installation of Xaraya). Also, when setting up the topnav block, follow the following conventions:
- name the block 'topnav'
- configure the block to use the 'topnav' template
- the block will go in the 'topnav' blockgroup


# The theme was designed to have an image in the top center block, and it looks good that way. You may want to consider including an image.

The same thing applies to the second block in the left column.

# The sitename will go next to the topnav block. Ensure you don't have a super-long sitename, or it will push the topnav block down.
