This theme DOES NOT produce XML, but the ical format as specified in
RFC-2445 [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt]

It started as one of those experiments to see how far we can stretch
BL and turned out the be something useful if treated with tender love
and care.

The idea is that since a theme is installation global you can provide
override only templates for any part of your installation to create a
dynamic calendar. 

The most common use would be to use something like Apple's iCal or
Mozilla's sunbird to 'subscribe' to the calendar. Basically any item
which has some sort of title, a date of some sort and an owner can be
made into an entry into a calendar.
