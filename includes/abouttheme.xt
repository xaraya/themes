<h1>About this theme</h1>
<p><strong>XBlue_Pro</strong> is a standards compliant, XHTML1.0 Strict and 100% table-free css theme. It was inspired by some brilliant, real-life examples of <strong>professional grade css positioning and styling techniques.</strong></p>
<p>The theme's 'active' area is 720px wide, self-centered on screen, with small margins at the top and the bottom. The built-in css classes allow up to 3 fixed width columns of content to be placed within the active area.</p>
<p>Although the theme's layout is not as flexible as in some other themes, it is pretty robust and may be well suited for small to medium size Xaraya projects. Types of websites that could be developed using similar layouts include:</p>
<ul>
  <li id="a2sdffgghj88">Client Centered site</li>
  <li id="a2sdffgghjgg">Small Brochure site</li>
  <li id="a3uopuouiohk">Informational... etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, we recommend that you treat this theme as a tutorial, an example of how to build your own css theme.</p>
