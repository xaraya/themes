As of this writing, this theme can be used in conjunction with the content module when you want a sitemap that includes just one content type.

For a sitemap that combines all content types, there is no need to use this theme.  Instead, use the content_user_sitemap() function, like so...
www.mysite.com?module=content&func=sitemap
